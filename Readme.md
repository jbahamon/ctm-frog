Frog is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)
- Some 12p details:
  * Blazing Strike (Stand ON) should have a follow-up rekka.

## Moveset

Frog can perform and chain many moves in midair, including some of his super 
moves. His Ground Heavy Attack can be used to launch the opponent into the air 
while following them. This allows Frog to start air combos.

### Special Moves

- **Slurp Cut**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 500 Power. A special throw using Frog's tongue. The tongue's length 
depends on the button pressed.

- **Leap Slash**: `F, D, DF + a/b/c` (Ground)

Frog jumps over the enemy and stabs downwards. The jump's range depends on the 
button pressed.

- **Water**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

A slow projectile that stays on the screen for a while.
The bubble's movement and final position depends on the
button pressed.

- **Line Slash**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Air)

Frog stops in the air and flies forwards, stabbing the enemy. 


### Super Moves

- **Bubble Rush**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

Requires 1000 Power. Frog releases a bunch of small bubbles that float towards
the opponent.

- **Water Stream**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

Requires 1000 Power. Frog creates a water pillar around him.

- **Mastermune**: `D, F, D, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Frog jumps and attempts to stab the oponent with the 
Masamune as he falls. If he succeeds, Masa and Mune will hit the opponent. 
Qualifies as a throw.

### Special Mode

- **Grand Dream**: `a + c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Frog unleashes Masa&Mune. It will follow you and attack 
as you do, spending Power with each hit it performs. Power is also lost when 
Masa&Mune gets hit. The mode ends when Frog runs out of Power.

### Final Move

- **Frog Squash Da**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing, must have Grand Dream 
activated)

Spends all remaining Power. A super throw. Masa&Mune throws a barrage of punches
If this move connects, Frog will perform a series of attacks, ending with a 
giant toad stomping on the opponent.


## 12p Mode

Frog's 12p Mode is based on DIO from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, specifically his
Heritage for the Future incarnation. As such, he has an additional button, `x`,
which activates/deactivates his *stand*, The World. DIO's moveset changes 
depending on whether The World is active; additionally, if The World is hit, DIO
will enter a hitstate too; if The World is KO'd (it has its own lifebar) DIO
will suffer a 'Stand Break'. The World's HP is gradually restored when it's not
active.

### Special Moves

- **Blazing Fists (Stand OFF)**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground, Stand OFF)

The World unleashes a barrage of punches while advancing. The button used 
determines the distance The World will advance. DIO is free to move while his 
Stand attacks.

- **Blazing Fists (Stand ON)**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground/Air, Stand ON)

The World unleashes a barrage of punches while advancing along with DIO. 
The button used determines the distance DIO and The World will advance. Mashing
the attack button will make the move last longer.

- **Blazing Strike (Stand OFF)**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground, Stand OFF)

The World rushes forward and throws a single hit before disappearing. The button
used determines the distance it will move before hitting. 

- **Blazing Strike (Stand ON)**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground, Stand ON)

Same as before, but DIO moves alongside his stand.

- **The World**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground, Stand OFF)

DIO teleports. The button used determines his final position.

- **Die!**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground, Stand ON)

DIO poses while The World moves behind the opponent and hits them from behind.

- **Stingy Ripper Space Eyes**: `F, c, b, a, F` (Ground, Stand OFF)

DIO charges for a bit before firing an unblockable beam.

- **Stand Activation Attack**: `D, DF, F, x` (Ground, Stand OFF)

The World hits quickly; this move leaves The World activated.

### 12p Super Moves

- **Checkmate-da! (Stand OFF)**: `D, DF, F, a+b/b+c/a+c` (Ground, Stand OFF)

Requires 1000 Power. DIO throws a bunch of knives at the opponent.

- **Checkmate-da! (Stand ON)**: `D, DF, F, a+b/b+c/a+c` (Ground/Air, Stand ON)

Requires 1000 Power. The World throws a bunch of knives at the opponent. If 
performed in the air, they are thrown diagonally towards the ground.

- **Roadroller-Da!**: `D, DB, B, a+b/b+c/a+c` (Ground, Stand OFF)

Requires 1000 Power. DIO jumps offscreen, and drops down something onto the 
opponent.

- **Tandem Attack**: `D, DB, B, x` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. DIO strikes a pose. While in this state, input commands 
will be stored; when the pose ends, The World rushes at the opponent and 
performs all stored commands in quick succession. DIO can move and join in the 
combo.

- **Bloody Summoning**: `b, a, F, a, c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. DIO and The World rush towards the opponent. If they hit 
them, DIO will grab their face and proceed to suck their blood.

- **The World: "Time Stop!"** `F, c, a, F, x` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. After a long startup, DIO freezes time. He can then perform
any attack he wants on his opponent: time will stay frozen as long as his 
continuously depleting Power hasn't run out.
