
Frog by SilentProtagonist 
================================

Frog is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version.

What's Missing:

- More palettes.
- Special intros and/or winposes, maybe.


Frog's Moveset
==============

Frog is intended to be a combo-heavy character. Try to chain his moves, 
launch your opponent into the air and finish it with a super move!
He also jumps higher than other characters, and some of his moves 
either launch him into the air or can be executed in mid-air. 
Keep these things in mind when playing as/against Frog.


Throws
--------------

**Slurp Cut**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing) Requires 500 Power.

A special throw using Frog's tongue. The tongue's length depends on 
the button pressed.


Specials
--------

**Leap Slash**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing).

Frog jumps over the enemy and stabs downwards.
The horizontal range of the jump depends on the button pressed.

**Water**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing/Air).

A standard, slow, projectile.
The bubble's movement and final position changes depending on the
button pressed.

**Line Slash**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Air).

Frog stops in the air and flies forwards, stabbing the enemy.


Supers
------

**Bubble Rush**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing/Air). Requires 1000 Power.

Frog releases many bubbles that float towards the opponent.

**Water Stream**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing/Air). Requires 1000 Power.

Frog creates a water pillar.

**Mastermune**: D, F, D, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Frog jumps and tries to stab the oponent with the Masamune.
If it succeeds, Masa and Mune are free to do as they please
with the opponent. This is a throw move, so don't try it against
enemies immune to those.

Special Mode
------------

**Grand Dream**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Frog unleashes Masa&Mune. They will follow you and attack as you do, 
spending Power with each hit they perform. You also lose Power when 
Masa&Mune get hit. When you run out of Power, they will dissapear.
Use this mode to perform long combos!

Final Move
----------

**Frog Squash Da**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing, must have Grand Dream activated). Uses all of your Power.

Masa&Mune throw a barrage of punches and hits. If this move connects, 
a series of attacks will be unleashed on your opponent. Can you guess
the reference? A clue: WRYYYYY.
